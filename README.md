# atmosphere_river_ep
This is a project to demonstrate the relationship between atmosphere rivers(ARs) and extreme precipitation(EP).
The end "name _v{x}.py" means different versions;they are slightly different in functionality and details,but all of these versions are stable.
All the code is used in Windows,the other operate systerm is not tested yet.

How to use?
First input your dataset ERA5 reanalysis and atmospheric rivers data and run the "ar_happen_calculate.py" and "precipitation_calculate.py";if your computer has no enough space or your operate systerm is windowsï¼Œthen you can run the "precipitation_output_v{x}.py" after runing "precipitation_calculate.py" file.
Find the file name as "{number}step_file_name.py" and follow the number to calculate these data and know how we demonstrate results.
The other statistic information is the rest python file.
